# piglin-barter-distro
CLI for calculating distributions for piglin bartering in Minecraft. I'm too lazy to add releases so just download everything and do `cargo run --release`. Also this is for 1.16.1 - 1.21.5, piglin barter chances are different outside of this range. May add a thing for that later.
